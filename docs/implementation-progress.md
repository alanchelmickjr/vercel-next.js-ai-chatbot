- Implement tool manager for deduplication and state tracking
- Build pipeline manager for multi-step tool calls
- Create cleanup service for failed or orphaned tools
- Implement API routes for tool management
- Create UI components for tool pipeline visualization
- Add system user IDs for system-initiated tools

### 5. Testing

- Test model changes without page refreshes

- Test tool call deduplication
- Test pipeline execution and visualization
- Test cleanup mechanisms for failed tools

## Implementation Details

### Fixed UI Refreshes & Reloads

The key changes to fix UI refreshes and reloads were:

1. **Cookie Handling**: Added a `noRefresh` option to `setClientCookie` to prevent page refreshes when setting cookies.

2. **Model Changes**: Updated the `updateModelString` function in `chat.tsx` to:
   - Update the React state immediately for UI feedback
   - Set cookies in the background without triggering navigation
   - Call server actions asynchronously

3. **Suggested Actions**: Modified the `handleSuggestionClick` function in `suggested-actions.tsx` to:
   - Use `needsUserInput` and `systemAction` flags instead of `autoExecute`
   - Avoid triggering new chat creation

4. **Multimodal Input**: Updated the `append` function in `multimodal-input.tsx` to:
   - Process tags without auto-execution
   - Allow user to submit manually

### Token Tracking

The token tracking system includes:

1. **Token Counter**: Functions to count tokens in text using appropriate tokenizers.

2. **Usage Tracking**: Middleware to track token usage for AI requests.

3. **Subscription Management**: Functions to check subscription limits and provide fallback models.

4. **API Endpoints**: Routes for recording token usage and checking subscription limits.

### Memory System

The memory system includes:

1. **Memory Manager**: Class for managing different types of memories (task, day, curated).

2. **Redis Integration**: Uses Vercel KV (Redis) for efficient memory storage and retrieval.

3. **Database Schema**: Schema for persistent storage of memory items.

4. **API Endpoints**: Routes for adding, retrieving, and clearing memories.

5. **Relevance Matching**: Simple keyword matching for finding relevant memories (can be enhanced with embeddings).

6. **Memory Tools**: Tools for AI models to interact with memory:
   - `add_memory`: Add a memory to storage
   - `get_memories`: Retrieve memories from storage
   - `clear_memories`: Clear memories from storage
   - `search_memories`: Search for relevant memories

### Tool Management System

The tool management system includes:

1. **Database Schema**: Tables for tracking tool calls and pipelines:
   - `ToolCall` table with nullable UUID userId field
   - `ToolPipeline` table with nullable UUID userId field
   - Indexes for efficient querying

2. **System User IDs**: Special user IDs (e.g., "SYSTEM01", "SYSTEM02") for system-initiated tools

3. **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Planned features for handling failed or orphaned tools:
   - Scheduled cleanup of stale tool calls
   - Automatic retry of failed tool calls
   - Orphaned tool detection

4. **Pipeline Visualization**: Planned UI components for users to see pipeline progress

## Next Steps

1. Complete the tool management system implementation:
   - Create TypeScript schema files
   - Implement tool manager and pipeline manager
   - Build cleanup service
   - Create UI components

2. Complete the memory system integration with the chat interface.

3. Implement comprehensive testing for all components.

4. Add documentation for the new features.
