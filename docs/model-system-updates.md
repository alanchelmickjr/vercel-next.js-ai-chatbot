# Model System Updates

## Changes Made

1. **Made Categories Dynamic**
   - Updated the categories API to support additional modality types (code, vision)
   - Removed hardcoded model mappings from current-model-display.tsx
   - Made the component use categories and models from the database

2. **Created Minimal Model Display**
   - Added a new minimal-model-display.tsx component that shows just the model name in a badge
   - Focused on Small/Large/Reasoning categories for a cleaner UI
   - Maintained compatibility with the existing model system

3. **Improved Model Selection UI**
   - Enhanced the dropdown to group models by category
   - Added user-friendly category names
   - Included fallback for when main categories aren't available

## How It Works

The system now:
1. Loads categories and models from the database via API endpoints
2. Displays models grouped by their categories
3. Allows users to select any model for any modality
4. Preserves the existing provider system in lib/ai/providers.ts

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Users can choose any model for any slot
- **Modularity**: Categories can be added or removed from the database
- **Simplicity**: The minimal display focuses on what users care about most
- **Maintainability**: Reduced hardcoding makes the system easier to update

## Next Steps

- Consider adding a category management UI in the admin section
- Add support for user-specific model preferences per category
- Implement automatic discovery of new models from providers
