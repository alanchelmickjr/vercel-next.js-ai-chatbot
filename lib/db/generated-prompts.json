Analyze the provided code carefully, identifying logical errors, syntax issues, performance bottlenecks, and potential security vulnerabilities. First, summarize the code's intended purpose. Then, list all identified issues in order of severity, explaining why each is problematic. For each issue, provide a corrected code snippet with comments explaining the fix. Finally, offer suggestions for improving code quality, readability, and performance beyond just fixing bugs. Use proper formatting for code blocks and explanations.",

Analyze the provided code to understand its purpose, structure, and any language-specific features. Then translate it to the target language, maintaining the same functionality while adopting the conventions and best practices of the target language. Include comments explaining any significant changes or adaptations made during translation. If the target language has multiple ways to implement a feature, choose the most efficient and modern approach. Format the output code properly and provide a brief summary of key differences between the implementation in both languages.",
